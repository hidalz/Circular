## Introduction

In Korea, Second-hand-market has been growing steadily.Because the consumer mentality due to capitalism, the new products are the norm, this leaves people with a lot of old things and no way of getting rid of them. In addition to this phenomenon, people are now connected with smartphones with spread of social medias. We can use these facts to develop a second-hand product trading application in the form of social media. With this application we will connect people who want to sell or buy second hand goods for a cheaper price to people who are closest to them.
